I have implemented the SALUTE, UXO, and MEDEVAC reporting processes which can be accessed through the main menu. 
The night mode button can make the app present content on a black background with red text for low-light scenarios.
You can fill in the reports following the prompt on each page, and the report will be saved once the user presses the submit button on the last page of each report. 
The saved reports can be accessed using the menu's view existing report(s) button.

*Note: this is a proof of concept prototype that does not have actual functionality to submit anything anywhere or authenticate any user*
